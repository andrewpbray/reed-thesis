# preface: >
#  Overall, the this study highlights the gains to model quality when including parameters of team composition rather than battle #decisions. Specifically in regards to Pokémon battling, the effectiveness of utilizing entry hazards is considered. Some evidence #is provided that supports the statistical significance of using entry hazards, but the variability between entry hazards is #highlighted in greater detail.The study lends support to the use of entry hazards as an effective Pokémon battling strategy, while # at the same time highlighting the limitations of using the results prescriptively in a Pokémon battle.

<!--
Above is the YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) header that includes a lot of metadata used to produce the document.  Be careful with spacing in this header!

If you'd prefer to not include a Dedication, for example, simply delete lines 17 and 18 above or add a # before them to comment them out.  If you have other LaTeX packages you would like to include, delete the # before header-includes and list the packages after hyphens on new lines.

If you'd like to include a comment that won't be produced in your resulting file enclose it in a block like this.

<!-- You'll need to include the order that you'd like Rmd files to appear in the _bookdown.yml file for
PDF files and also delete the # before rmd_files: there.  You'll want to not include 00(two-hyphens)prelim.Rmd
and 00-abstract.Rmd since they are handled in the YAML above differently for the PDF version.
