This study attempts to answer a question pertaining to game strategies: is it beneficial to pursue strategies that do not immediately damage an opponent? Furthermore: is the impact of these strategies dependent upon when the moves are used? These questions are tested using data from a popular online Pokémon battling game, Pokémon Showdown. This study tests whether the use of specific moves positively contribute to a player's likelihood of winning a battle. This study finds surprisingly uniform results. Evidence shows that when players utilize moves that do not directly damage their opponent, they have a higher likelihood of winning a game. Additionally, moves considered complementary to these strategies positively impact a player's likelihood of winning a game more than only utilizing moves that do not directly damage their opponent. Furthermore, this study provides evidence that these effects are more pronounced when a player pursues these strategies earlier in a game, defined as within the first five turns of a game.
