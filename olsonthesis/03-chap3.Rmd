The average game length is sixteen turns. However, there are a number of games in the dataset that are of zero length. To eliminate potential bias from these games, all models will be specified to only include games that lasted more than one turn. A few other facts stand out from the preliminary statistics. Specifically in regards to ranking, most observations are within the range of 1000 to 1215 elo. However, the maximum rank observed in the data is 1815. To test whether the statistics differ in higher tiers of ranking, the final model will include all battles lasting at least one turn and all ranks and one for games whose ranking is greater than the third quantile of 1215 elo.
