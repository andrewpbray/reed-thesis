#### This Week

** I met with Chester and worked on getting the thesis template working with R. Some issues were encountered when updating R/Rstudio and keeping git integration. I was nonetheless able to commit and push the current template to the github repository.** 

** I seem to have lost one of the books I was hoping to include in my Lit Review. I will be looking for it and reading it as soon as possible. In the meantime, the Lit. Review is taking priority**

#### Next Week 

** The Lit. Review is due tomorrow, October 3rd. This will be a difficult deadline to meet, and work on this has the potential to extend into the week. Beyond this, the remaining four points of interest are still on the to-do list. Mainly, I would/will be prioritizing reparametrization of Pok√©mon battling.**

** Additionally, large blocks of preliminary text need to be pruned and edited. Currently they have example code for adding lists, figures, and other thesis-related items.** 

*Q: Does the Lit. Review need to be in the thesis template with exposition?*
