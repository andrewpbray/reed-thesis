#### This Week

**I met with Bray and went over the basics for making a Github repo. I was able to fork the thesis-folder template that Bray made and included both Bray (andrewpbray) and Lau (yanlau852) as collaborators.**

**I met with both Bray and Yan to discuss the data and general topics to cover in the weeks to come. Generally, Yan will aid in providing game theory related information. Namely, this should concern the theoretical framework to anaylze Pokémon battles. On the other hand, Bray will aid in providing information about big data computations.** 

#### Next Week 

**The main to-do is to add relevant literature for the lit-review folder. This includes adding summary descriptions of each document. The due date for the literature review is the most recent due date to tackle.**

**Additionally, I need to begin the theoretical framework for Pokémon battling. The main issue to tackle is reducing the number of relevant parameters.**

**I need to decide between using jsonlite or sqlite for making data computations. More importantly, I need to begin preliminary data computations. The initial computation should include the distribution of turn length for battles. Other ideas for preliminary computations will be noted as need be.** 

**As a low priority goal, I need to apply for IRB data exemption. Tangentally related to this is creating unique IDs for each user included in the Pokémon Showdown battle logs. This can be done after preliminary data and/or theoretical work**
