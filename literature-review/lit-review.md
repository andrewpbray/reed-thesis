- **Title:** Percymon: A Pokemon Showdown Artifical Intelligence
- **Summary:** The two authors created an algorithm for the purposes of playing Pokémon Showdown against human players. The paper gives a brief overview of the underlying battle format along with designing a framework to categorize certain characteristics of Pokémon battling. 
- **How does this relate?** Most notably, the paper focuses specifically on Pokémon Showdown. Additionally the work gives general details about what distinguishes Pokémon Showdown from the Pokémon games. The paper aids in detailing what areas of battling were excluded for the purposes of minimizing computation time. Additionally, the authors are transparent about what scenarios they excluded from the algorithms functions, i.e. discarding the use of not very effective moves against the opponent's Pokémon.

- **Title:**Sistemas Inteligentes: Reportes Finales Ago-Dic
- **Summary:** The author uses a number of different algorithms to attempt to simulate and play games. One specific instance of this is using a 1v1 Pokémon battle algorithm. 
- **How does this relate?** This paper directly quotes the equations used for damage, accuracy, and other notable factors that influence the course of play in a Pokémon battle. However, the paper focuses exclusively on 1v1 battles without a great deal of concern for usage statistics or battle formats. The work is the most simplistic, but offers an initial stepping stone for analyzing Pokémon within a specific framework.
